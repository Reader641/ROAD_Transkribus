# ROAD_Transkribus

Iâ€™d like us to experiment with a platform called Transkribus next.

Register for an account here: [https://readcoop.eu](https://readcoop.eu)

Enter into their web app, Transkribus Lite: [https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/iiif/p16003coll20/7/full/full/0/default.jpg](https://app.transkribus.eu/)

Then upload a photograph of handwritten text, like this one: [https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/iiif/p16003coll20/7/full/full/0/default.jpg](https://cdm16003.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/iiif/p16003coll20/7/full/full/0/default.jpg)

And walk through the steps of getting it automatically transcribed. There's documentation on their website. Explore it a bit, and document what you find in markdown. Start a new repo for that purpose.

What I'm really interested in is getting you to the point where you can use their API to upload an image, trigger its transcription, and then retrieve that transcription. Here's their documentation, but when you're ready for that step, I've also got some (imperfect) code of my own that you can borrow/build on: [https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/docu/rest-api/](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/docu/rest-api/)
